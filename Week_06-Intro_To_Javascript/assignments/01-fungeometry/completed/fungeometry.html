    BUT DON’T CAP­I­TAL­IZE WHOLE PARA­GRAPHS. THIS HABIT ORIG­I­NATED WITH LAW­YERS AND HAS IN­FECTED SO­CI­ETY AT LARGE. THUS, MANY WRIT­ERS STILL BE­LIEVE THAT CAP­I­TAL­IZA­TION COM­MU­NI­CATES AU­THOR­ITY AND IM­POR­TANCE. “HEY, LOOK HERE, I’VE GOT SOME­THING IM­POR­TANT TO SAY! I DE­MAND THAT YOU PAY AT­TEN­TION!” BUT A PARA­GRAPH SET IN ALL CAPS IS VERY HARD TO READ. AND IT’S EVEN HARDER TO READ IF IT’S BOLD. AS THE PARA­GRAPH WEARS ON, READ­ERS FA­TIGUE. IN­TER­EST WANES. HOW ABOUT YOU? DO YOU EN­JOY READ­ING THIS? I DOUBT IT. BUT I REG­U­LARLY SEE CAP­I­TAL­IZED PARA­GRAPHS THAT ARE MUCH LONGER THAN THIS. DO YOUR READ­ERS A FA­VOR.
